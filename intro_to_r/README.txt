For the final project in my Introduction to R course, we were allowed to choose our data and analyze that data from what was learned in the class.
The BillBoardsYearlyTop100.pdf is the slide show given to the class, describing why I chose this data, what I found from analyzing it, and how in the future would I like to continue with the project.
BillboardTopLyrics.rmd shows the R code used to analyze. Compared to what I know now, this analyzation is more of a starting point to finding out questions one might have when first looking at the data. 
This is a project I will be continuing with to see what kind of predictions I could make. Not only with using data, but diving more into the ethics of data as well, which is a very strong passion of mine.
