Linear Regression was on of my favorite courses because it is a cummulation of much learned throughout my few years at USF. Here are a couple labs
that I completed in the course from where I started (Lab1.pdf) to our final lab (Lab6.pdf).

Lab1.pdf helped introduce the class to what linear regression really is, an introduction to JupyterNotebook and a virtual environment. Lab1.pdf uses python
to read in the relevant data (in this case the data is 'bike_share.csv'), assign variables, plot the current data, fit it to a linear model and figure out what the data means. In the end our goal
was to show the linear relationships of bike rentals to different types of weather and see what kind of graphs would be useful in our linear model.

Lab4.pdf analyzes the Forestry.csv data which has information about 35 confierous trees and their variables. I dug deeper into different visualzations, mathematical techniques such as residuals and correlations, Cook's D
statistics to overall validate that the model is correct.

Lab5.pdf analyzes the hitters.csv data which contains information about batters from major league baseball to again dig deeper in the statistics such as multicollinearity, variable selection using different methods and 
validation techniques to predict future salaries.

Lab6.pdf also uses the hitters.csv data to piggyback off of Lab5.pdf, but digs into other techniques such as ridge and lasso regression to best predict the lowest chance of error.
