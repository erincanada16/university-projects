The final project in Relational Databases took data from the University of Minnesota where we inputed the data into our database, analyzed the data, designed the schema, and answered many useful questions through different queries.

ecanada-code.sql include the bulk of the sql code performed in the analysis to answer specific questions.
ecanada-process-databases.py is a script to clean the data to be inputed into the database.

ecanada-project-report.pdf is the final report of the analysis of the data. In my opinion, this is an interesting format (we had to use Google Docs to be able to share with the professor) and I would like to redo this
in the future to make it more presentable. This project was definitely squished in time for the class so again, in the future, would love to redo a majority of this project.

All of the text files include the data cleaned by the script and inputed in the database.

movies.zip is the data directly from the University of Minnesota.
