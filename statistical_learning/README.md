Statistical Learning was a brand new course offered at USF and again, personally one of my favorites. I dove deep into the mathmatical concepts of all of the major machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, gradient descent, neural networks, PCA, and multiclass logistic regression.

Movie data is the final project done in this course where I could chose the data to analyze and test each of the machine learning techniques and compare 
their outcomes. I did not use the previous projects  where I built the algorithms, but used the python packages which is most likely to be done in the 'real world'. The algorithm projects definitely help me to understand each of these concepts better to use these pacakges more efficiently in the future.

Binary Classification, Gradient Approximation, PCA MNIST, and Perceptron Algorithm are all concepts implemented from scratch.
Neural Network was not implemented from scratch, but was an assignment challenge to who could get the highest accuracy in the class with neural networks. I recieved 2nd place.
