Final Project Movie Revenue.pdf is the final file containing the code from final_project.py and analyzations of the full project and contains data found on Kaggle.com which includes the title, budget, revenue, cast, crew, etc. However for the sake of this project
and time, I considered a simple sample of this data (train_2.csv) including, title, budget, runtime and genre to ultimately predict the final revenue. Future consideration include the full data set.
