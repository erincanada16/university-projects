This project implements multiclass logistic regression from scratch using gradient descent to train the MNIST data and the Iris data
and predicts the accuracy of this method to future classify images.

MultiClassLogReg.py inludes the functions to be used by classify iris and classify mnist.

Both png files are the graphs produced by the semology plot created in the classification.
