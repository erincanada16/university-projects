This MP3 Player was created as the final project in Intro to Object Oriented Programming, demonstrating a majority of what I learned within the class. 

MP3Class.java creates the class of the mp3 player holding information such as the song title, artist, album, and the file of the song.
MP3FileFinder.java  will read in an absolute path and count the total number of valid mp3 class files found recursively.
MP3List.java creates an ArrayList of type MP3Class and provides methods for that list.
MP3ClassBuilder.java reads in the files found from the MP3FileFinder and creates the MP3Class objects that will be added to the ArrayList of Mp3Classes.
SongComparator.java and AristComparator.java are implemented to control how the songs and artists are sorted.

Player.java was not code written by myself, but used for the purpose of this project assigned by the professor.
MP3Test.java was code written by the professor to test our project. 

Included are also sample songs to be used by the MP3 Player.
