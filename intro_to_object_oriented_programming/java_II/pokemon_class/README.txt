This project was the first implemented when learning java. Here I built the pokemon class based on the data from pokemon.csv

In Pokemon.java defines a pokemon based on species, height, weight, experience, and if it was a favorited pokemon.
Pokedex.java creates an array list of all of my pokemeon being able to find average height, weight, most experience and stature to fight my battles with ease.
PokedexBuilder.java takes input the pokemon.csv to build my pokedex.
PokemonDriver.java tests my code to see its accuracy.
