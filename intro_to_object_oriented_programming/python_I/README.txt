TipCalc.py is a basic program that takes input the total bill from a restaurant and how the service was from a scale between 1 and 10 and outputs how much should be tipped to the server.

PigLatin.py takes text as input (usually a poem) and goes through each word of the txt, creates a list of characters. If there is any punctuation, it is accounted for to keep this at the end of the word. If there is no punctuation, it parses the 
translates it to pig latin. Then it creates an output file of the text as piglatin and counts how many words/lines were translated.
