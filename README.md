# University Projects

Showcasing previous projects and assignments completed at the University of San Francisco

## Intro to R

Intro to R taken in Spring 2017 at USF, taught by James Wilson. This class was designed for most science majors and no coding background to learn how to program the basics with R and R studio. Bi-Weekly labs were completed, weekly homework assignments, occasional project and final project were completed throughout the semester. By including the Top Billboard 100 Final Project, I want to showcase my beginning abilities with the use of R studio, passion for music and future projects that I want to piggy back of of this completed project.

## Intro to Object Oriented Programming I/II

Intro to Object Oriented Programming I was completed at Chapman University in 2016 when I first started getting into technology and heavily sparked interest in switching to this particular major. Here is where I first learned any coding, starting with Python. I include a couple of projects from that time to show where I started and how far I have come. Some of my favorites were TipCalc.py where a user inputs a number between 1 and 10 indicating the service performance and the price of the meal to indicate how much should be tipped to that server. Another would be PigLatin.py where a poem will be taken as input and will output that poem in pig latin. 


Intro to Object Oriented Programming II was taken in Fall 2017, taught by Sami Rollins. This was my first experience using Java and for a beginner, it was an intense class for me. It was a lot of hard work, but in the end it was totally worth it and made me a better programmer. Though tough, we got to complete some fun projects. Our very first project was to create a Pokeman and Pokedex with a given pokeman.csv file. Another project I included was our final project was building an MP3 player using all of our knowledge learned in the class finishing with multi-threading. 


## Data Structures and Algorithms
Data Structures and Algorithms was taken in Spring 2018, taught by EJ Jung. In this class, we covered everything from stacks, queues, lists to indexing and sorting to graph algorithms and heap structures. Projects were given to implement these ideas from scratch to really understand how these concepts work and show improvement. Included projects are my implementation of ArrayLists, Bucket Sort and Insertion sort.


## Relational Databases
Relational Databases was taking in Fall 2018, taught by Maria Daltayanni. Relational databases introduces data modeling, record storage, and file organization, as well as database theory; relational, hierarchical, and network models; database management systems and query languages,and programming language interfaces to databases.  This course included homeworks, labs and projects to lead to a better understanding of databases. The final project was broken up to three stages which was completed the last half of the semester. The data comes from the U of M  where we inputed the data into our database, analyzed the data, designed the schema, and answered many useful questions through different queries.

## Linear Regression
Linear Regression was also taken in Fall 2018, taught by Nathaniel Stevens. Within this course we were taught the mathematical basis of Linear Regression supplemented by homeworks, coding in both Python and R (labs) and exams. Included is a lab done both in Python which goes over the linear relationship of different ascpects of weather and fit it to a linear model. Also included is another lab but done in R which goes over shrinkages methods in regards to major league baseball data.


## Statistical Learning
Statistical Learning was taken in Sprin 2019, taught by Daniel O'Conner. Statistical Learning introduced different concepts of machine learning, such as Multple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, Decision Trees, etc. In each class we would go over the mathematics of how each concept works, and would take to coding projects to implement these ideas from scratch to really understand and then implement python packages using these different models to see which performs better on different datasets. Included is a couple assignments where these models were implemented from scratch and then the final project where I studied movie set data and tested different models to see if the movie would gross more than the budget. Future ideas will also be discussed on how this can be improved, and further progress to ultimately predict the gross earning of the movie.
